Project Description: Statistical Analysis and Portfolio Optimization of 10 Stocks

In this project, portfolio theory principles are used to construct an optimal portfolio from the 10 chosen stocks. 
The goal is to balance risk and return effectively by leveraging Python libraries.

Here are the key steps we’ll follow:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
  Gather historical stock price data for the 10 selected stocks (e.g., from Yahoo Finance).
  Calculate daily returns for each stock using percentage change.

2. Risk and Return Metrics:
  Compute the expected returns and standard deviations for each stock.
  Understand the risk associated with individual assets and the entire portfolio.

3. Correlation Analysis:
  Calculate the covariance matrix to understand how the stocks move together.
  Assess correlations between pairs of stocks.

4. Efficient Frontier and Mean-Variance Optimization:
  Construct the efficient frontier, which represents the optimal trade-off between risk and return.
  Use mean-variance optimization to find the portfolio weights that maximize return for a given level of risk (or minimize risk for a given level of return).

5. Portfolio Construction:
  Determine the optimal allocation of funds across the 10 stocks.
  Compare portfolios based on metrics and risk-tolerance of different investor groups.

6. Visualization and Interpretation:
  Visualize the efficient frontier and the selected portfolio.
  Interpret the results and provide insights for investors.


Expected Outcome: 
By the end of this project, we’ll have a well-constructed portfolio that balances risk and return, allowing investors to make informed decisions about their investments.
